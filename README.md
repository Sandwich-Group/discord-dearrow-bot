# Discord DeArrow Bot

A simple Discord bot to respond with DeArrow titles, if it finds any.

## Motivation

There is an existing [DeArrow bot](https://github.com/SB-tools/DeArrow-Bot) that
works fairly well, but we found it to be too intrusive. Instead, we built our
own that leaves the original message intact and only responds with a new title.
